lessons = {
    "🌍 CO₂ & Climate Science": {
        "How trees help reduce CO₂ levels": "Trees absorb CO₂ through photosynthesis and store it in their biomass.",
        "The greenhouse effect and global warming": "CO₂ traps heat, causing extreme weather and sea-level rise.",
        "Understanding CO₂ sequestration": "Trees, duckweed, and vetiver naturally capture and store carbon long-term.",
        "CO₂ Absorption Formula": "`CO₂ = Age × CO₂_per_year × Survival Rate × Growth Factor` — Example: 1 × 25 × 0.85 × 1.0 = 21.25 kg CO₂",
        "Why reducing CO₂ is urgent": "Too much CO₂ leads to climate disasters. Every tree makes a difference."
    },

    "🌱 Tree Planting & Afforestation": {
        "What is afforestation and reforestation": "Afforestation means planting trees where there were none before.",
        "Benefits of native species": "Neem, Peepal, and Pongamia grow well locally and support biodiversity.",
        "Tree growth and CO₂ capture": "Fast-growing trees absorb more CO₂. Long-living ones store it longer.",
        "Caring for saplings": "Water regularly and protect young trees, especially in the first 2 years."
    },

    "🔥 Deforestation & Its Impact": {
        "What is deforestation?": "Cutting down forests for farming or roads removes vital carbon sinks.",
        "Main causes of deforestation": "Farming, urban growth, logging, and forest fires reduce tree cover.",
        "How deforestation affects climate": "Fewer trees = more CO₂, less rain, hotter climate, and erosion.",
        "How afforestation helps reverse it": "Planting trees restores green cover and balances ecosystems."
    },

    "🪴 Duckweed – Tiny Plant, Big Impact": {
        "Duckweed and CO₂ removal": "Duckweed grows fast and absorbs CO₂ rapidly in water bodies.",
        "Duckweed’s climate role": "It purifies water, stores carbon, and makes biofuel.",
        "Where duckweed thrives": "Freshwater ponds, tanks, and village lakes are ideal."
    },

    "🌾 Vetiver Grass – A Green Protector": {
        "Vetiver for CO₂ absorption": "Vetiver roots store CO₂ underground and stop soil erosion.",
        "Why vetiver is climate-smart": "Grows in drought, floods, and poor soils — ideal for India.",
        "Vetiver's extra uses": "Used in perfumes, medicine, and water treatment near roads and canals."
    },

    "🧪 Soil & Growth Factors": {
        "Soil types and tree health": "Neem loves sandy loam; tamarind prefers red soil for strong roots.",
        "Understanding soil pH": "Ideal pH is 6.0–7.5 for healthy plant growth. Test your soil before planting.",
        "Survival & growth factor": "Survival = how many live. Growth = how fast they grow. Both affect CO₂."
    },

    "🌿 Climate & Community Topics": {
        "Urban Heat Islands & Cooling Trees": "Trees reduce local temperatures and make cities cooler.",
        "Air Quality & Trees": "Trees trap dust and absorb pollutants like NO₂ and SO₂.",
        "Water Conservation & Tree Roots": "Roots improve soil water retention and recharge groundwater.",
        "Biodiversity Boosters": "Trees provide food and shelter for birds, bees, and animals.",
        "Youth, Schools & Tree Missions": "Students planting trees build eco-awareness and green school yards.",
        "CO₂ Tracking with Technology": "Apps and satellite tools track how much CO₂ trees absorb.",
        "Agroforestry: Trees + Farming": "Trees with crops improve yield and reduce soil erosion.",
        "Forest Fires – Causes & Prevention": "Vetiver and native trees reduce fire risk by acting as fire-breaks.",
        "Indian Forest Laws & Missions": "CAMPA, Green India Mission support afforestation in India.",
        "Local Community & Job Creation": "Tree projects create jobs in nurseries, planting, and care."
    },

    "🌟 Why This Project Matters": {
        "Your role in climate action": "One tree planted = less CO₂, more oxygen, and a better future.",
        "Supporting the SDGs": "This project supports SDG 13 (Climate), SDG 15 (Life on Land), and more.",
        "East Godavari impact": "Real tree data + local focus helps communities make informed green decisions."

- Duckweed can double its mass in just 2 days and remove CO₂ 10x faster than some trees!
- Vetiver roots can grow over 3 meters deep, stabilizing soil and capturing underground carbon.
- Afforestation can reduce temperature in urban areas by 2°C or more.
- Students who plant trees are more likely to engage in future climate actions.
